I wonder how hard it is going to be to pick pieces I like out of one or more Android ROMs and add them to my own AOSP-based ROM. To start finding out, I am currently downloading both the AOSP repo & the CyanogenMod repo. Then I guess it will be time to dig into both via Eclipse. This should be interesting.
