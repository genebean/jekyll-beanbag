Over the years, my digital photos have gotten spread out across Google Photos, Dropbox, Facebook, and Apple. I’ve been hearing good things about Immich so I decided to try consolidating all these sources into it. More specifically, I want to no longer depend on there being a copy of my images on Google Photos, Dropbox, or Facebook and I want to back up what’s in iCloud and/or on my iPhone. I intend the result to be a unified view of everything and to also serve as a backup. With regards to the latter, not only will a self hosted instance of Immich be a backup of the cloud services, but I’ll literally take a backup of Immich with restic every day and store it encrypted in Backblaze B2.
