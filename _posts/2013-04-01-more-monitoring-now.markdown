As some may have noticed, I have had a few site issues lately. Those should be in the past now. As a result of these issues, I am now actively monitoring this site & it’s server via Zabbix. If I can compile all the pieces of the different guides I used to set it up in between other thing I’ll post it here. Until then, here’s the short version:

ClearOS @ home + v2.0 packages from EPEL = Zabbix server

Latest client installed via Portage with the ~amd64 flag.

Monitoring of server stats and website checks setup.

Notices sent via email

Alerts on my phone via AndZabbix Pro.
