I decided it was time to stop procrastinating and actually update the live version of my blog to the one I have been working on for a while. So, here it is: *The Comfy Seat*: Ghost edition.

The new site is built on v0.11.4 of Ghost from [https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost "TryGhost/Ghost on GitHub") and fronted by Nginx. Some additional improvements will be coming soon as will more posts (I hope).
