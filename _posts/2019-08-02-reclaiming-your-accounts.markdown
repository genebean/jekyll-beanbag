This post is a quick reference guide for what I recommend people do when someone has gotten into their accounts on various platforms.

## Facebook

When you notice (or someone tells you) that someone else has been doing things with your account like sending people messages here are the steps you should take:

1. Change your password immediately.
2. Then, do this to kick them out of your account by following [this Facebook help article](https://facebook.com/help/211990645501187/).
3. To keep it from happening again, consider following [this Facebook help article](https://facebook.com/help/148233965247823/).

## Instagram

Dealing with Instagram is pretty much the same as Facebook (and may be exactly the same if that's how you log into it):

1. To get them out, change your password immediately.
2. To keep it from happening again, consider following [this Instagram help article](https://help.instagram.com/566810106808145).
