So… I was perusing [RootzWiki](http://rootzwiki.com) looking for the next great Jellybean ROM for my phone and noticed that frequently dev’s need a place to mirror things.  With that in mind, I think I will look into a good way to mirror some files and also to provide torrents for any mirrored file.  This should be interesting…
