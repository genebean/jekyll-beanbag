I want to setup a system based around the open source [Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet) software stack… I am just not sure what the stack contains. My goal is a system that is holistic where Puppet, VMware vSphere, monitoring, revision control, and continuous integration all play well together. I also want to bring [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [Packer](http://www.packer.io) into the mix for development environments. I’ve gathered so far that all the stuff listed in the title will be useful but what else is needed? Please comment below and I’ll also post again as I find answers.
