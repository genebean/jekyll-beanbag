#### Alert if door to garage left open

This one utilizes an [Aqara Door and Window Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D37VDM3) mounted to the door between our kitchen and garage to let us know if it gets left open. This is critical for us for two very distinct reasons:

1. We have a toddler and don't want him to fall down the stairs to the garage or wander down there where he could get hurt.
2. We don't want our dog or cat to get into the garage either as both could get hurt or inadvertently get outside.

If the door is left open a push notification gets sent to mine and my wife's phone, a Telegram message is sent to me so that I will see it on my computer, our SONOS speakers announce that the door is open and, if it's between 8:30am and 5pm, an announcement is also made on the Echo Show 5 that resides on each of our desks.
