title: Editing Posts on iOS
---

As it so happens, I'm not always around a computer when I want to edit a blog post or the documentation for a project I'm working on. I've found several apps designed to make writing on an iPhone or iPad easy and enjoyable. Most of these apps support and/or focus on writing in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). Markdown is commonly used by blogging platforms and is the standard for documentation pages on GitHub. Many of the apps talk about syncing work between devices and some also simplify publishing to WordPress and Medium. Surprisingly though, there's very little said about editing markdown files from a git repository. This post is going to layout the tools and processes I've found that make it possible to write on iOS, save to GitHub, and then publish to one or more blogging platforms.
