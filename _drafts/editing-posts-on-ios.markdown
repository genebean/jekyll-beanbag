title: Editing Posts on iOS
---

As it so happens, I'm not always around a computer when I want to edit a blog post or the documentation for a project I'm working on. I've found several apps designed to make writing on an iPhone or iPad easy and enjoyable. Most of these apps support and/or focus on writing in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). Markdown is commonly used by blogging platforms and is the standard for documentation pages on GitHub. Many of the apps talk about syncing work between devices and some also simplify publishing to WordPress and Medium. Surprisingly though, there's very little said about editing markdown files from a git repository. This post is going to layout the tools and processes I've found that make it possible to write on iOS, save to GitHub, and then publish to one or more blogging platforms.

## Desired Outcomes

The main things I was looking for when I starred down the rabbit hole of investigating writing apps for iOS were live preview of markdown and a way to integrate with my GitHub repositories. I also wanted to be able to easily see a fully rendered version of my document from within the same app. The other thing I was seeking was integration with Medium. Integration with WordPress was also something I was keeping an eye out for as a nice-to-have. My motivation primarily came from wanting to make edits to a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog post I’m working on.

##  The Contenders

* **Bear:** supports markdown but is a walled garden - no access to files outside of it and no external synchronization.
* **Byword:** seems to meet all editor requirements but no git integration. Also has git formatting
* **Drafts:** doesn’t seem to support external files
* **iA Writer:** seems to meet all editor requirements but no git integration
* **Markdown Pro:** seemed good but didn’t appear to support Medium or WordPress. Also doesn’t seem to have any git integration.
* **Working Copy:** does all the git stuff and has an editor. The editor doesn’t directly support Medium or WordPress and is generally lacking vs Byword
